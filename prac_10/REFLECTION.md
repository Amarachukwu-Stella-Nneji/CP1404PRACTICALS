# ESTIMATES
Regarding my accuracy, I can say that it improved during the course. The reason is that in programming1 I was not good at all, but now I am getting better.
This journey of improvement is especially seen when I compare my current accuracy to my experience in Programming 1, where I initially faced challenges.
My improvement comes from practicing regularly, using course materials, and asking for help when things are unclear. 
This ongoing progress shows I'm on a learning journey, and I'm excited to keep getting better.

## CODE REVIEWS
Being Reviewed:
When my code is reviewed, I've learned to appreciate suggestions made. 
It's also an opportunity for growth and improvement in my code, helping me see alternative approaches. 
Receiving feedback encourages a mindset of continuous learning and collaboration.

Doing Reviews:
Performing code reviews taught me the importance of clarity and empathy. 
Providing feedback in a constructive and respectful manner is crucial. 
It's not just about pointing out issues but also recognizing positive aspects. 

### Practical Tasks
The practical tasks, as designed, seem well-suited to meet the subject's objectives, leaving little room for improvement.
The current structure of the course effectively covers a wide range of skills. 
I would maintain the existing structure, regularly evaluating its effectiveness through student feedback.
